###The pro's and con's of libraries / frameworks###
---
###Pro's
***A lot of functionality / features***  
Libraries and frameworks are built with this in mind: To help the developer code a project with a lot of pre-built functionalities. Every library / framework has their own features, so developers can pick one they think is best for their project.


***Efficiency of development***  
Due to clever use of pre-built functions, the time it take to write code can be significantly reduced. Writing code in vanilla JavaScript could take ten times as long, if not longer.


***Advanced knowledge of the vanilla language is not necessary***  
If you are not that familiar with vanilla JavaScript, using libraries or frameworks could come in quite handy. You'll find an easy fix for the problems you face with libraries like jQuery.


***They're (almost always) free***  
All the big libraries and frameworks come without costs. Because you save time with the enitre development of the project, the cost to the client reduces as well. 


***They bring a new perspective on code-development***  
Each library / framwork uses it's own syntax. When you are learning a new library or framework, you take a look a JavaScript from a different perspective than you are used to. This could help in getting to know JavaScript a bit better.

####Con's
***The learning curve could be steep***  
Because JavaScript frameworks carry a lot of functionality with them; getting used to the specific framework could be very difficult.


***A lot of unused functionalities, which will loaded anyway***  
The JavaScript will have a larger file-size, because of the included functionalities. Though you might not use everything that comes with the library / framework, it'll still be included in your source-code.


***You will not fully learn the vanilla language***  
When you decide to use a JavaScript framework, you also decide to not take the time to fully learn the language. By doing this, you won't be able to figure out how to solve bigger problems you might face, later in development.


***Ugly code***  
Quick fixes with libraries like jQuery can result in a huge mess, where vanilla JavaScript and jQuery are used in the same file, with no consistence being applied. 


***Impossible to master them all***  
Every library and framework has unique functionalities. Because of this, developers compare the different ones to pick a library / framework to built their project with. However, because of the large assortment, you can't possible master every one of them.
