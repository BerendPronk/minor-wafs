####Pro's
***Single-page applications are fast***  
The only thing that updates, is the data. The HTML, CSS, Javascript, et cetera, never changes. This means that those files do not have to be requested to the server again.

***Caching of local storage***  
All data can be stored locally, for faster loading times. The app can even work offline like this.

***Bridge to mobile-app***  
Itâ€™s easier to make a mobile application, because you can reuse the same backend code for web application and native mobile application.

***Not needed to refresh the page***  
The page will automatically (if requested) load in new data via AJAX.

***It decreases bounce-rates compared to other websites***  
Because there is not a lot to do on single-page applications, users are more likely to interact with all of the visible content.

####Con's
***Single-page applications tend to be slower on the landing***  
Because the single-page needs to gather all the necessary files of the used framework, the pageload time will increase.

***SEO is not as good as on Multi-page websites***  
The application will not contain all the data for search engines to acces. Single-page applications also don't have a sitemap, which will be good for the site's SEO.

***Possible XSS threads***  
Single-page applications are less secure. Due to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), it enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web application by other users.
